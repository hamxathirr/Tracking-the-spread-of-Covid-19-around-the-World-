It tracks the spread of Covid-19 across the globe in order to provide necessary information for governments to tackle it by learning from its trends globally.  I've started by analyzing the data for Mainland China, where the pandemic originated. I've shown time evolutions and snapshots of Confirmed, Recovered cases as well as Deaths. Then moved to explore the evolution of the pandemics in the rest of the World.  For both Mainland China and the rest of the World I'm also showing the snapshot and time evolution of mortality, calculated in two ways: as Deaths / Confirmed cases (most probably an underestimate) and as Deaths / Recovered cases (most probably an overestimate).
